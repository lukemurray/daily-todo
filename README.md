# Daily Todo
Super simple todo application for the desktop (currently?).

## Why?
Maybe something else exists, but I couldn't find anything that worked the way I wanted. I tried everything I found, Trello, Asana, Todoist, etc. They all end up doing too much, I get why, that's where there is possible money. Daily Todo just lets me
- Add things I need to do
- Check them off
- View it to check what I should be doing
- Reorder priority (which I do in the morning)
- Stay out of my way
- Say yay, I did some things at the end of the week
- Start again

# Running
Currently
